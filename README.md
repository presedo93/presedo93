# Hi there, I'm Rene! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Sofware Developer in between of two worlds! I love to do Machine Learning but I also have a lot of fun doing Software Development ðŸ™ƒ. Here it is a little bit about me:

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about software architectures.
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on cool projects! Lately, I've got some interest in financial ML ones.
- ðŸ¥… 2022 Goals: work on a reinforcement learning project!
- âš¡ Fun fact: I do really love football âš½ and Dark Souls games.

## Some background...

#### **What I've done**

During my college years I learned <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/303480/c-logo.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="C++" />, it was my first programming language and the one who accompanied me in learning all about computer science!

My first job was on computer vision projects, using mainly <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/354139/opencv.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="OpenCV" />. And from that, I started to learn about Machine Learning! I introduced myself into <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/354238/python.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="Python" /> and worked with <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/354440/tensorflow.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="Tensorflow" /> and <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/354240/pytorch.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="Pytorch" />. Lately, I've been doing, in my free time and also at work, some full-stack development. So, I've learned about <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/349419/javascript.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="Javascript" />/<img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/349540/typescript.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="Typescript" />. And I've been doing code for <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/330413/fastapi.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="fastAPI" /> for the backend and <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/374175/vue.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="Vue.js" /> for the frontend!

I'm passionate about stock markets and economics so when I'm not working on other projects, I usually spend some time developing tools for backtesting on <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/3286/bar-chart.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="Bar chart" /> using tools like <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/354127/numpy.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="numpy" /> and <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/306534/pandas.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="pandas" /> or reading books!

#### **What I'm currently learning**

Related to software development, I've started to learn about <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/374056/rust.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="Rust" />, I felt in love of its concept of ownership and borrowing and I'm thinking on doing some backend development using it. I'm also doing some projects using <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/354259/react.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="React" />, learning about was something that was on my mind...

On the Machine Learning side, I'm putting some effort on reinforcement learning <img width="12px" src="https://www.svgrepo.com/show/29869/robot.svg" style="padding-right:5px; padding-left:5px" title="Reinforcement learning" />. I've dealt with Computer Vision, Natural Language Processing and even Time Series projects and now it is time to learn something about RL!

<br />

## So in summary...

I love to learn about cool topics and interesting technologies! As I said before I'm between two worlds. I do really love to do Machine Learning but this last years I've found a lot of fun doing full-stack development ðŸ˜„.
